<h3><i>About Me!</i></h3>
</div>
Hi! I am currently a senior at Kennesaw State University. My major is Computer Science and my minor
    is Mathematics. I was the Technology Ambassador at Women in Technology Campus at KSU and also worked as
    a Mathematics Tutor at the SMART Center. I am a member of the Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society
    and the South Asian Student Association here at KSU. <br>I have a twin sister who also goes to KSU.
    I was born  in Lansdale, Pennsylvania and lived there for six years before moving to India,
    where I lived for the next twelve years. I came back to USA to finish
    my education where I settled in Atlanta, Georgia. My hobbies include reading books,
    watching TV shows, listening to music, and learning new languages. I also like playing basketball.
    I interned with Honeywell over the summer and worked on process mining and process orchestration. It was
    a really great experience and I enjoyed it a lot.
    <br>Created for my SWE 4633: Cloud Software Development class!!
